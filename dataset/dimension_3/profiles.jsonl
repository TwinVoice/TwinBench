The discussion involves the wind's influence on their activities and plans for someone coming to see them. They are considering how to handle the situation when the visitor arrives, including offering food and a place to rest. The atmosphere seems casual, with a focus on daily concerns and household arrangements. The characters are planning their next steps based on the weather and the visitor's needs."

They are only something of mine, papa, she faltered, whilst Stephen leapt out, and, assisted by the lodge-keeper’s little boy, crept about round the wheels and horse’s hoofs till the papers were all gathered together again. He handed them back to her, and remounted. She could not help colouring at the confession, much as she tried to avoid it. Stephen listened as she explained her notes for a romance she was writing, and she admitted that she mostly wrote bits of it on scraps of paper when on horseback for convenience."

The copse-covered valley was visible from this position, a mist now lying all along its length, hiding the stream which trickled through it, though the observers themselves were in clear air. They stood close together, leaning over the rustic balustrading which bounded the arbour on the outward side, and formed the crest of a steep slope beneath Elfride constrainedly pointed out some features of the distant uplands rising irregularly opposite."

Mr. Swancourt had left the room. Elfride’s guilt showed in her face. Stephen became the picture of vexation and sadness, which, relishable for a moment, caused her the next instant to regret the mistake she had made. She said sweetly that she did not mean it in contempt for his skill and explained her reasons for her actions, emphasizing her conscience and the manfulness of his effort."

So entirely new was full-blown love to Elfride, that she trembled as much from the novelty of the emotion as from the emotion itself. Then she suddenly withdrew herself and stood upright, vexed that she had submitted unresistingly even to his momentary pressure. She resolved to consider this demonstration as premature. You must not begin such things as those, she said with coquettish hauteur of a very transparent nature. And—you must not do so again—and papa is coming."

'That’s common enough; he has had other lessons to learn. Now, I recommend this plan: let Elfride ride on horseback, and you, Mr. Smith, walk beside her.'"

I hope you don’t think me too—too much of a creeping-round sort of man, said he in a penitent tone, conscious that he too had lost a little dignity by the proceeding. You are too familiar; and I can’t have it! Considering the shortness of the time we have known each other, Mr. Smith, you take too much upon you. You think I am a country girl, and it doesn’t matter how you behave to me!"

She expressed her feelings about their situation, mentioning that it was hardly proper for them to be there and that they had not known each other long enough for this kind of thing. Stephen responded that it was quite long enough, and they discussed the nature of their acquaintance. She was worried that her papa might suspect or know what she was doing, emphasizing how new the situation was for her. Stephen wished they could be married and asked if she loved him deeply."

Stephen and Elfride were engaged in a quiet, intimate conversation, their thoughts drifting with the flying bird. Elfride was curious and probing, seeking to understand Stephen's feelings. The atmosphere was light and filled with a gentle warmth. They were sharing a tender moment, lost in their own world."

The conversation reveals her emotional state and her perspective on the dilemma posed by the other character. The dialogue is part of a larger discussion about love, loyalty, and personal choice. The characters are exploring complex feelings and moral questions."

Somewhere in the kitchen garden, I think, she replied. That is his favourite evening retreat. I will leave you now. Say all that’s to be said—do all there is to be done. Think of me waiting anxiously for the end. And she re-entered the house. She waited in the drawing-room, watching the lights sink to shadows, the shadows sink to darkness, until her impatience to know what had"

The conversation reveals a tense moment as they discuss the presence of a dead man beneath the tomb. The young man looks at the tomb with a mixture of curiosity and sadness, reflecting on the revelation.

This act of alighting upon strange ground seemed all that was wanted to complete a resolution within her. She looked at her betrothed with despairing eyes."

They ran down the staircase—Elfride first—to the booking-office, and into a carriage with an official standing beside the door. “Show your tickets, please.” They are locked in—men about the platform accelerate their velocities till they fly up and down like shuttles in a loom—a whistle—the waving of a flag—a human cry—a steam groan—and away they go to Plymouth again, just catching these words as they glide off: “Those two youngsters had a near run for it, and no mistake!”"

Yes, I see, said Elfride softly and thoughtfully. But of course it is different quite with men. Why don’t you write novels, Mr. Knight? Because I couldn’t write one that would interest anybody. For several reasons. It requires a judicious omission of your real thoughts to make a novel popular, for one thing. Is that really necessary? Well, I am sure you could learn to do that with practice, said Elfride with an ex-cathedra air, as became a person who spoke from experience in the art. You would make a great name for certain. So many people make a name nowadays, that it is more distinguished to remain in obscurity. Tell me seriously—apart from the subject—why don’t you write a volume instead of loose articles? she insisted."

Yes, yes; I was speaking of when you are not obliged for any other reason than delight in the prospect of fame. I have thought many times lately that a thin widespread happiness, commencing now, and of a piece with the days of your life, is preferable to an anticipated heap far away in the future, and none now."

At that moment, by reason of a slight perturbation his words had caused in her, Elfride’s foot caught itself in a little tuft of grass growing."

Elfride had not; but she had begun to take for her maxim the undoubted truth that the necessity of continuing faithful to Stephen, without suspicion, dictated a fickle behaviour almost as imperatively as fickleness itself; a fact, however, which would give a startling advantage to the latter quality should it ever appear. Knight, by one of those inexcusable oversights which will sometimes afflict the best of players, placed his rook in the arms of one of her pawns. It was her first advantage. She looked triumphant—even ruthless."

Her father was concerned about her obsession with the game and warned her about making herself a slave to it. Despite his objections, she insisted on playing, expressing her desire to overcome her previous loss. Knight agreed to her wish, and they withdrew to the library to play."

By the time he had reached the wicket-gate he saw that she had moved, and waited till she came up. Elfride had closed the note-book, and was carrying it disdainfully by the corner between her finger and thumb; her face wore a nettled look. She silently extended the volume towards him, raising her eyes no higher than her hand was lifted. Knight asked if she could understand it, and she replied that she had looked but didn't care to read much. She explained that she didn't wish to read because she didn't want to."

She could not but be struck with the honesty of his opinions, and the worst of it was, that the more they went against her, the more she respected them. And now, like a reckless gambler, she hazarded her last and best treasure. Her eyes: they were her all now. Honestly, or as a compliment? Of course honestly; I don’t want anybody’s compliment!

The Knight was engaging her in a playful yet pointed conversation about her preferences between a library of music and a pair of earrings. She responded with a stammer, indicating her hesitation and internal conflict. The Knight then pressed her further, asking which she would prefer if she could buy the earrings afterward.

There was no check, order, or anything of the nature of guarantee. In fact the information amounted to this: the money was now in the St. Launce’s Bank, standing in her name. She instantly opened the other letter. It contained a deposit-note from the bank for the sum of two hundred pounds which had that day been added to her account. Stephen’s information, then, was correct, and the transfer made. “I have saved this in one year,” Stephen’s letter went on to say, “and what so proper as well as pleasant for me to do as to hand it over to you to keep for your use? I have plenty for myself, independently of this. Should you not be disposed to let it lie idle in the bank, get your father to invest it in your name on good security. It is a little present to you from your more than betrothed. He will, I think, Elfride, feel now that my pretensions to your hand are anything but the dream of a silly boy not worth rational consideration.” Leaving this matter-of-fact subject, he went on, somewhat after his boyish manner: “Do you remember, darling, that first morning of my arrival at your"

About a month before the wedding, she and my lord and the two children used to ride about together upon horseback, and a very pretty sight they were; and if you’ll believe me, I never saw him once with her unless the children were with her too—which made the courting so strange-looking. Ay, and my lord is so handsome, you know, so that at last I think she rather liked him; and I have seen her smile and blush a bit at things he said. He wanted her the more because the children did, for everybody could see that she would be a most tender mother to them, and friend and playmate too. And my lord is not only handsome, but a splendid courter, and up to all the ways o’t. So he made her the beautifullest presents; ah, one I can mind—a lovely bracelet, with diamonds and emeralds. Oh, how red her face came when she saw it! The old roses came back to her cheeks for a minute or two then. I helped dress her the day we both were married—it was the last service I did her, poor child! When she was ready, I ran upstairs and slipped on my own wedding gown, and away they went, and away went Martin and I; and no sooner had my lord and my lady been married than the parson married us. It was a very quiet pair of weddings—hardly anybody knew it. Well, hope will hold its own in a young heart, if so be it can; and my lady freshened up a bit, for my lord was SO handsome and kind. How came she to die—and away from home?"

Monteagle was more than usually grave; not only from his want of sleep on the preceding night, but because he thought he had detected the source of Julia’s gaiety, and the mistake under which she labored. At length, when Monteagle rose to retire, Julia contrived to place herself near the door, and as he went out, half asleep, and feeling very dull, she softly whispered the one word ‘Hope!’ Monteagle started as if struck by an arrow at this confirmation of his fears. The poor girl had mistaken his gravity and dullness for that despair which Brown had taught her to believe he was laboring under, and had ventured to tell him that he might hope!"

But all in vain. Life had forever left that darling form, dearer to him than all the gold that strews the placers of his native land. When Joaquin became certain that she was indeed dead, his grief at first found vent in the most pathetic lamentations; but suddenly pausing, he dashed the teardrops from his eyes, and drawing a dagger from its sheath, he swore upon its cross-hilt eternal vengeance on the ravishers and murderers of his Carmencitto."

Her dark hair was pulled straight back from her small face, with a rather sweet absence of coquetry; or was it, instead, the very quintessence of coquetry, brought to a fine art? Her big brown eyes were bigger and browner than ever, and her slim, almost childish little figure—which looked so adorable always in its young-girl frocks before the footlights—looked incomparably adorable in a straight, severely cut little white wrapper, like the robe of an early martyr.
